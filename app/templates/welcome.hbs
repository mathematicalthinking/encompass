  <h1>Mathematics teaching and learning has been challenged to evolve, since
    2020, especially in its use of online tasks.</h1>
  <p>In the ORCIDS project, teachers, researchers and other math educators are
    focused on ways to engage more meaningfully with students online.
  </p>
  <p>Together we are learning about selecting good tasks for doing math in a
    virtual context and developing strategies and experience with software
    designed to help us see, think about and build on students work. And
    it&apos;s all designed to take place asynchronously — without the camera on.</p>
