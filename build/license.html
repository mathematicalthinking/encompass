  <h2>Guidelines to distinguish Non-commercial and Commercial Use if EnCOMPASS.</h2>
  <p>Whether a particular use of the EnCOMPASS Materials is "non-commercial" depends on the use, not the user, and to assist we have set out the notes below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Non-commercial Use</strong>. We anticipate that non-commercial use will primarily involve students and teachers who may wish to
      use EnCOMPASS at home and in school or university for the purposes of their school or academic study and teaching, without intending to
      seek any commercial advantage or financial gain. This includes teachers in schools and universities where tuition fees are charged,
      so long as the use of EnCOMPASS is limited to personal or individual classroom teaching.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial Use</strong>. We anticipate that commercial use will primarily involve publishers, online schools, schools or
      universities charging tuition or course fees where there is systematic or formal integration of EnCOMPASS within the curriculum,
      and non-profit organizations who wish to use EnCOMPASS to support activities that are intended toward securing a commercial advantage
      or the generation of revenue or monetary compensation. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Examples of commercial use might include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>use of EnCOMPASS (or any related materials or resources) to generate or develop educational materials or resources which will be sold in
      exchange for a fee (including course or tuition fees) or (if given away for free) which are used to gain a commercial advantage for the user;</li>
    <li>the provision of training, support or editorial services that use or reference EnCOMPASS (or any related materials or resources) in exchange for a fee;</li>
    <li>use of EnCOMPASS (or any related materials or resources) within a non-academic ebook, textbook or journal, whether or not the book or journal
      is distributed for a fee. Please note that academic papers, conferences, and books do not require a License and Collaboration Agreement; and</li>
    <li>use of EnCOMPASS (or any related materials or resources) to assist in securing advertising or sponsorship type revenues.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="FAQ"><h2>EnCOMPASS License FAQ</h2></a>
  <h3>What exactly is the EnCOMPASS software?</h3>

  <p>When we refer to 'EnCOMPASS' software or as a product, we are really referring to the code and materials residing in the <a href='https://github.com/orgs/mathematicalthinking/encompass'>EnCOMPASS Github Repository</a></p>

  <h3>Who can use EnCOMPASS free of charge?</h3>

  <p>EnCOMPASS and our web services are made available <a href="https://files/mathematicalthinking.org/license">EnCOMPASS License</a> free of charge for non-commercial users
    (with an <a href='https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html'>AGPL V3 License</a>). Most
    of our users are students and teachers and they usually fall under our non-commercial license, allowing them to use and distribute EnCOMPASS
    and related materials free of charge at home and in school.</p>

  <p>Commercial users pay a moderate license fee, which helps us to continually improve EnCOMPASS and keep it free for non-commercial users.
    Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://files/mathematicalthinking.org/license">EnCOMPASS License</a> on how we distinguish non-commercial and commercial use.
    If you are not sure whether your use is commercial or not, please just get in touch with us at
    <a href="mailto:sweimer@21pstem.org">sweimer@21pstem.org</a>.</p>

  <h3>Is EnCOMPASS free and open source software?</h3>

  <p>EnCOMPASS is open source software and available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.EnCOMPASS.org/license">free of charge for non-commercial users</a>.
    You can find our&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/orgs/mathematicalthinking/encompass'>EnCOMPASS Github Repository</a> and we are open to collaborating with the open source
    community.
    Thanks a lot to all contributors of these projects for their great work!</p>

  <p>Please note that EnCOMPASS is "open sourced", and not necessarily "free" software. It seems only fair that
    someone is going to make money off of the EnCOMPASS software, that some of that revenue go back to supporting EnCOMPASS and other projects of Mathematical Thinking. You can rest
    assured that our license terms the GNU AGPL V3 license has been checked by an experienced law firm.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, EnCOMPASS will always continue to be available free of charge for students and teachers for
    all major operating systems.  For your convenience our Github repository includes instructions for installation.  If you find any errors, or wish to have instructions for other versions of the Linux O/S, please let us know at (?????).</p>

  <p>The developers of EnCOMPASS (Mathematical Thinking) is dedicated to the open source movement and collaboration with members of the FOSS community – please check out our <a href='https://github.com/orgs/mathematicalthinking/encompass'>EnCOMPASS Github Repository</a>.
