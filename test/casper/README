## Executing

The tests can be run with mocha-casper:

  mocha-casperjs test/casper/*.js

or with grunt:

  grunt mocha_casperjs

## Host

The host needs to be identified (current default is http://localhost:8080) in config.json (see config.json.example)

## Overview

The goal of these full stack integration tests is to make sure things are working together.  Related: cover things that are impossible (or too hard) to do with unit tests.

The risk is writing every test as an integration test and not knowing what layer things broke at.  

Perhaps one rule of thumb or starting point is to cover the cross product of the operations and the models.

CRUD x Models

              Create  Read  Update  Delete
Users            X    X       X
Workspaces            X
Folders               X
Submissions           X
Selections            X
Taggings              X
Responses        X    X
